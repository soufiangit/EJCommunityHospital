	‚Ä¢	BED: BedNumber, PatientID
	‚Ä¢	PERSONNEL: PersonnelID, Name, Phone, Email (one or two), Address, Hire-date, Position
	‚Ä¢	DEPARTMENT: DepartmentCode, DepartmentName

	‚Ä¢	Patient-Personnel

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Normalization & ER/EER Diagrams:
	‚Ä¢	Draw ER/EER diagram using tools such as Dia or Visio.
	‚Ä¢	Normalize the tables up to the 3rd Normal Form (3NF).

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è SQL Implementation:

Use MS SQL Server Management Studio and commands:
	‚Ä¢	CREATE TABLE for table definitions.
	‚Ä¢	INSERT INTO to populate each table with realistic data (at least 3 rows per table).

üìä R Integration for Data Analysis:

Prerequisites:
1. Install R from https://cran.r-project.org/
2. Install RStudio (recommended) from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
3. Required R packages: DBI, odbc, tidyverse, lubridate

The hospital_analysis.R script provides:
- Patient demographics visualization
- Treatment cost analysis
- Test results distribution analysis

To use the R script:
1. Open hospital_analysis.R in RStudio
2. Update the database connection parameters with your SQL Server details
3. Run the script to generate visualizations and analyses

Note: Ensure you have appropriate ODBC drivers installed for SQL Server connectivity.
